# A Data-Visiualization Web Application

This is a proof-of-concept project that explores the use of the `DBI` and `pool` packages to create a simple data-visualization Shiny app that queries from a remote database.

Documentation may be found in this repository in the `www` folder.

The app itself is deployed at [https://homer.shinyapps.io/countries](https://homer.shinyapps.io/countries/).
